## Adding new features

This section includes advice on how to build new features for the project & what kind of process it includes. 

If you want a feature that the app doesn't have yet, check out our [Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/avgp/kein-stress-mit-pollen).

### If there is no story for it on the board, add one
* Login with Github
* Type your story in the "title" box on the top lefthand corner. Use the following format ``As a ROLE So that GOAL I want FEATURE``, e.g. "As a user So that I only see the pollen I am allergic to, I want to filter the trees displayed on the map".
* Hit Add
* Your story is in!

## If there is a story for it on the board, work on it
* If your story is on the "Ready" column, we'd be happy if you help us making it happen. Drag to "in progress" and start working (see below)
* If your story sits in the "Backlog" there is some clarification needed. Comment on the issue and let's get this moving together!

## Working on a story
The workflow usually looks like this:

1. You fork the repository
2. You clone your own fork
3. You move the story to "in progress" and assign yourself
4. You go into coding awesomeness mode
5. You push into your fork and make a pull request with the story and some comments on what you did exactly.
6. A maintainer reviews and merges your pull request or comments on suggestions or questions we should address before merging.

**Donâ€™t get discouraged!** We estimate that the response time from the maintainers is around: 1 week.
